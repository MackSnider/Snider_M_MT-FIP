# Mackenzie Snider Midterm FIP (snider_m_MT-FIP)

This project was made for my Midterm for the FIP at Fanshawe College. Submission is for Interactive Media Design.

## Motivation

I was very motivated to make this project. I had a lot of fun developing all the components for this submission.

## Usage

While this project is for a class submission, it helps me further understand the world of website design. I can use my new found knowledge to help my dad create a BANGER website (lol)
